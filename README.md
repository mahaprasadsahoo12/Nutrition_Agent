## 🚀 How It Works

1. User opens the chat interface and types a query like:  
   > “Suggest a vegetarian meal plan for weight loss.”

2. The agent extracts context (diet type, goal) and generates a day-wise meal plan.

3. The user can follow up with:  
   > “Swap rice with a healthier option.”  
   And the agent suggests:  
   > “Quinoa is a healthier choice—it’s high in protein and fiber.”
